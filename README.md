## Training Algorithms

### Fully Sharded Data Parallel
ZeRO-optimized data parallelism with configurable optimizer state partitioning. Best for memory-constrained setups and large models.

```bash
bash scripts/launch_fsdp_train_gpt.sh
```

**Features:**
- ZeRO Stage 0: All-Reduce (classic data parallelism)
- ZeRO Stage 1: Optimizer state partitioning (~1/N memory per worker)
- Bandwidth-optimized weight broadcasting (only owned parameters)
- Configurable bounded staleness (0 = strict sync, K > 0 = async up to K steps)
- Real-time staleness monitoring via WandB

### Classic Data Parallelism (ClassicDP)
All-Reduce based data parallelism with bounded staleness. Best for balanced clusters with moderate network latency.

```bash
bash scripts/launch_dp_train_gpt.sh
```

**Features:**
- All-to-all gradient averaging (ring all-reduce)
- Configurable bounded staleness (0 = strict sync, K > 0 = async up to K steps)
- Real-time staleness monitoring via WandB
- Automatic stale gradient cleanup

### Elastic Distributed Parallelism
Asynchronous data parallelism with stale gradient tolerance. Best for heterogeneous clusters.

```bash
bash scripts/launch_edp_train_gpt.sh
```

### Synchronous Parameter Server (SyncPS)
Synchronous data parallelism with barrier coordination. Best for homogeneous clusters.

```bash
bash scripts/launch_syncps_train_gpt.sh
```

### Expert Parallelism (EP)
Mixture-of-Experts training with experts sharded across nodes. Best for scaling MoE models efficiently across heterogeneous hardware.

```bash
bash scripts/training/launch_ep_train_moe.sh
```

### Model Parallelism (MP)
Layer-wise model distribution. Best for large models and inference serving.

```bash
bash scripts/inference/launch_inference.sh --algorithm mp
bash scripts/inference/launch_api.sh
```

See [training.md](docs/training.md) for detailed algorithm comparison and usage.

## Monitoring

### Weights & Biases
Real-time experiment tracking at [wandb.ai](https://wandb.ai)
- Training/validation metrics
- Per-layer gradient norms
- Hardware utilization

### Grafana + Loki
Centralized log aggregation at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Distributed logs from all nodes
- Real-time log queries
- Error tracking

See [logging.md](docs/logging.md) for setup instructions.
